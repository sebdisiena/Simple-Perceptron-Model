# Simple Perceptron Model

## Objective
- Project to learn about the simple perceptron neural network and supervised learning
- Labelled dataset is produced through 2 seperate normally distributed data points
- **Aim:** Seperate the data into 2 discrete classes through linear regression

## Method
- Model utilises the **sigmoid activation function** to determine the probability for a data point to be placed within the positive region
- The **cross entropy error** is calculated to determine the error of the regression line
- **Gradient Descent** is implemented to iterate through the line parameters (i.e. weight 1, 2, and bias) to produce a linear model with minimal error

## Mathematical Equations
- Linear model: x1 x2 b
- Sigmoid activation function: (1/(1+e^-x)) 
- Cross entropy error:
- Gradient descent:
