Project to start learning about the perceptron using Juypiter Notebook

Data is generated through 2 seperate normally distributed points 

Model of perceptron neural network and supervised learning

Algorithm which seperates data into 2 discrete classes through linear regression

Error calculated through the 

sigmoid activation function (1/(1+e^-x)) to provide probability (>50% = positive region) used to classify alongise linear regression function

cross entropy to calculate the total error for a linear model

gradient descent to minimise the error to obtain a better linear model
